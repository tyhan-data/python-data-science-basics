# Python Final Practice – Data Science Oriented

This repository contains my Python practice work focused on building a strong foundation for Data Science and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## 📌 Topics Covered

* Python Functions
* List Comprehensions & Data Filtering
* String Manipulation
* Conditional Logic & Loops
* Dictionary Operations
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

  * Inheritance
  * Multiple Inheritance
  * Method Overriding
  * super() and **kwargs
* Data Science style basic problems

  * Average calculation
  * Maximum value
  * Pass/Fail analysis
  * Sorting and filtering data

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository is organized into multiple Python files, each focusing on a specific concept:

* Functions and list practice
* String processing
* OOP inheritance examples
* Multiple inheritance examples
* Advanced super() and kwargs usage
* Mini data analysis exercises
* Final combined OOP challenge

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:

* Strengthen Python fundamentals
* Practice clean and readable code
* Build a solid base for Data Science
* Prepare for exams, interviews, and real-world problem solving

## 🧠 Learning Status

This practice reflects my transition from beginner to intermediate level in Python and OOP, with a focus on logical thinking and structured programming.

## 🚀 Future Plan

* Add Pandas and NumPy practice
* Work on small Data Science mini projects
* Improve code efficiency and documentation
